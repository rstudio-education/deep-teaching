# Deep Teaching

You've put deep learning on your to-do list, but how about deep teaching? This one day workshop introduces education best practices to programmers and data scientists.  Among the topics it covers are:

- how the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts affect what and how you teach;
- using formative assessment to keep teaching on track in real time;
- what cognitive load is and how to design lessons that take it into account;
- how to use slides effectively;
- teaching as a performance art; and
- what motivates and demotivates adult learners.
